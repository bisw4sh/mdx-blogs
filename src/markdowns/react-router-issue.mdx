## React Router - Content disappear on refresh (client route access)

[Issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27928372/react-router-urls-dont-work-when-refreshing-or-writing-manually/54765884) - React Router is client side routing and when a url is requested to server, it has no such route.

### Fixes

1. HashRouter - has # before all routes, clever hack, ugly and issues with google console redirect url.
2. Express server to distribute static assets.
3. [...alot more here](https://ui.dev/react-router-cannot-get-url-refresh) for webpack on dev servers, apache server.

1. **\_redirects** file on public folder with following content.

```
/*  /index.html  200
```

**_worked on netlify_**

2. Vendor specific solutions

1. Netlify  
    **_netlify.toml_** file on root directory with the following content:

    [[redirects]]
    from = "/*"
    to = "/index.html"
    status = 200
    force = false
    ```

    }
    ```
