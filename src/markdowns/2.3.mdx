# 2.3 Technical and Management Perspective of Software Architecture

**Perspective** refers to a specific viewpoint or angle from which a system is viewed. A technical perspective explains the technical level of a system's view. **Software architecture defines the structure, behavior, and patterns that guide the elements, collaborations, and composition of software systems.**

## 2.3.1 Management Perspective

From a management perspective, there are 3 different aspects of an architecture:

1. **architecture** : intangible design concept
2. **architecture baseline** : is a _(tangible artifact)_ slice of information across the engineering artifact sets sufficient to satisfy all stakeholders that the vision can be achieved within the parameters of the business case ( cost, profit, time, people).
3. **architecture description** : organizes subsets of information extracted from the design set model.

## Importance of software architecture

- provides a basis for balancing the trade offs between problem space and the solution space.
- Poor arch and immature processes are often given as reasons for project failures.
- Plan makes a predictable outcome.
- Arch and process definition are intellectual steps that maps the problem to a solution without violating the constraint.

## 2.3.2 Technical Perspective

**An architecture framework** is a set of minimum practices and requirements for artifacts used to describe a system's architecture. It explains the concept of views, which are abstractions of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) designs. The framework provides principles and practices for developing, interpreting, analyzing, and using an architecture description within a specific domain or stakeholder community.

**An architecture view** represents the architecture in a way that is meaningful to one or more stakeholders. It represents the functional and non-functional requirements of a software application. **A view is a partial expression of the system from a specific perspective, while a viewpoint is a collection of patterns, templates, and conventions for developing a particular type of view.**

The model which draws on the foundation of architecture developed at Rational Software Corporation and particularly on Philippe Kruchten's concepts of software architecture:

##

The diagram illustrates the following architectural views:

1. **Use case view**: Used in requirements discipline to plan technical content and model static and dynamic aspects of use cases.
2. **Design view**: Organizes design information, addresses structure and functionality, and explains architecturally significant features.
3. **Process view**: Deals with dynamic aspects, describes processes, communication, and runtime behavior, including control thread relationships and synchronization aspects.
4. **Component view**: Addresses the source code realization from the perspective of integrators and developers, with conventional, process-related, and object-oriented views.
5. **Deployment view**: Explains the distribution of processing across nodes, physical distribution of processes and fields, and the environment within which the system runs and executes.

Architecture descriptions take on different forms and styles in different orgizations and domains. The actual level of content in each set is situation-dependent, heuristics is relied upon for the purpose.
Generally, an arch baseline should include the following:

1.  **Requirements** : critical use cases, system level quality objectives.
2.  **Design**: names, attributes, behaviors, relationships.
3.  **Implementation**
4.  **Deployment** : executable components suffice to demo the critical use cases and risk associated.
